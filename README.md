# Express-EJS-React-TypeScript-Template
An express server built with a variety of tools such as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

## Tech Stack
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/)

## Running Locally
Once you have cloned the repo down, you will need to run the following commands to setup the build.
- `npm i` - Install all required dependencies
- `npm run sync` - If you install any dependencies in the **client** or **server** directories, you can run this script to add them to the main project package.json.
- `npm run dev` - Compiles the project with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and starts the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.
